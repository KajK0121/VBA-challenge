# VBA-challenge

This is my Module 2 Challenge

This repository provides you with a script that analyses a multi-stock data.
The script loops through the data and provides the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year as well as the total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting was used to highlight those that had positive yearly change (green) and those that were negative (red)

A separate table shows tickers that had the greatest percentage increease, decrease and the greatest total stock volume
